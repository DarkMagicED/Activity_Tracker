I know very little of how to create an executable, in fact this project will serve as my introduction to everything that is needed to accomplish a fully functional activity tracker that I plan to use on a daily basis.
I am familiar most with Python, so I will be seeking to maximize its usage

Great progress -> with the aid of ChatGPT I have learned how to use the terminal in VS code, how to navigate to my repository using cd, and list contents with ls commands. 
Calendar.py is created, and in it I was suggested by Alex (I asked ChatGPT for a human name it would like to be refered to) to import the calendar module which is included in Python's standard library
Alex also helped me navigate to and execute with the command -> python calendar.py

upon execution, i am prompted for input: year, and month. Year as a 4 digit int and month as an int between 1 - 12. When these inputs were sent within guidelines a text based, formatted calendar was output in the vs terminal.
This is great, because it looks very similar to the end product that I have in mind, however I would like all 12 months to appear side by side with eachother.
I have attempted to input "1-12" but this gave an error

The calendar module has 768 lines total. I will review these to see what other functionality it may already have built in that can serve the project.
